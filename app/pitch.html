<p>Our team has an interesting story. The two of us are from India and the other two are from Pakistan (hint hint, Kashmir), but that&#8217;s exactly the point. RefuServe is not an app, but rather, and idea. An idea that wars, political aspirations, and territorial disputes at home are irrelevant here. That&#8217;s why all of us decided to come to Europe out of all places; because that&#8217;s what the EU is all about &#8211; It&#8217;s about working together, in harmony, for the collective good of society. And that&#8217;s why we built RefuServe, a platform to help refugees find their place in the European work force by learning new skills and overcoming the language barrier. We want to help the refugees realize what Europe is all about.</p>

<p>I want to end by quoting Jeremy Rifkin, the author of &#8216;The European Dream&#8217;: &#8220;Can we reach global empathy in time and save the the people of the Earth?&#8221;</p>
